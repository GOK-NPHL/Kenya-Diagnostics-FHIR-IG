# Kenya-Diagnostics-FHIR-IG

Welcome to the Kenya Diagnostics FHIR Implementation Guide (IG). This IG aims to provide comprehensive guidance on the implementation of FHIR resources and profiles for health diagnostics in Kenya.

In this IG, you will find detailed information on the FHIR resources and profiles specific to health diagnostics, including laboratory tests, imaging studies, and clinical observations. We will explore how these resources can be used to capture and exchange diagnostic data in a standardized and interoperable manner.

Furthermore, this IG will cover best practices for mapping existing diagnostic systems and terminologies used in Kenya to FHIR, ensuring seamless integration and data exchange across different healthcare systems. We will also discuss considerations for data privacy, security, and consent management when implementing FHIR for health diagnostics.

Whether you are a healthcare provider, software developer, or policy maker, this IG will serve as a valuable resource to guide you through the implementation of FHIR for health diagnostics in Kenya. Let's embark on this journey together and unlock the potential of FHIR to improve healthcare outcomes in our country.
